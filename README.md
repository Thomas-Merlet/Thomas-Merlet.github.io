This repository contains all the files of my portfolio accessible at [http://thomas-merlet.github.io](http://thomas-merlet.github.io). You can discover detailed articles describing some of my experiences.

My portfolio is designed under Jekyll. I adapted my website from an online template, designed by [artemsheludko](https://github.com/artemsheludko).
